Wanted to get a feel for rust by doing some reinventing of the wheel.

It just generates a simple AST from an expression. I've included a REPL that just prints out the AST instead of evaluating the expression.

One day I will come back to this and make my own VM with bytcode generation or try to compile with LLVM after I add in a couple more things like variables.
